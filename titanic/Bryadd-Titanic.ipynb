    "So right out the gate we were able to get like 82% which is phenomenal. The next step is to figure out - is it going to be worth our time to improve this? If we are going to get a five percent increase for 3 months of work, maybe. But if we get .0001% increase no way. \n",
    "\n",
    "Before we decide how to make our model better we need to decide if it's worth keeping. One trick is to look at the data ourselves. We know that 67.5% of the people on the titanic died. If we guess on each person that each person died, we'd be right 67.5% of the time. So that's our baseline - anything lower than 68% is bad model performance, because why would I need it? We could just say everyone died and get a better score. \n",
    "\n",
    "Before we do that, let's just look at a manual decision tree, something we can do every time we look at data to see if just screwing around we can get a better model than a computer. This defines our \"baseline\" of performance to know if we should try to make it better or not. \n",
    "\n",

    "Copy and pasting the below for reference from this guy's guide. \n",

    "Our rule of thumb will be the majority rules. Meaning, if the majority or 50% or more survived, then everybody in our subgroup survived/1, but if 50% or less survived then if everybody in our subgroup died/0. Also, we will stop if the subgroup is less than 10 and/or our model accuracy plateaus or decreases. Got it? Let's go!\n",
    "\n",
    "Question 1: Were you on the Titanic? If Yes, then majority (62%) died. Note our sample survival is different than our population of 68%. Nonetheless, if we assumed everybody died, our sample accuracy is 62%.\n",
    "\n",
    "Question 2: Are you male or female? Male, majority (81%) died. Female, majority (74%) survived. Giving us an accuracy of 79%.\n",
    "\n",
    "Question 3A (going down the female branch with count = 314): Are you in class 1, 2, or 3? Class 1, majority (97%) survived and Class 2, majority (92%) survived. Since the dead subgroup is less than 10, we will stop going down this branch. Class 3, is even at a 50-50 split. No new information to improve our model is gained.\n",
    "\n",
    "Question 4A (going down the female class 3 branch with count = 144): Did you embark from port C, Q, or S? We gain a little information. C and Q, the majority still survived, so no change. Also, the dead subgroup is less than 10, so we will stop. S, the majority (63%) died. So, we will change females, class 3, embarked S from assuming they survived, to assuming they died. Our model accuracy increases to 81%.\n",
    "\n",
    "Question 5A (going down the female class 3 embarked S branch with count = 88): So far, it looks like we made good decisions. Adding another level does not seem to gain much more information. This subgroup 55 died and 33 survived, since majority died we need to find a signal to identify the 33 or a subgroup to change them from dead to survived and improve our model accuracy. We can play with our features. One I found was fare 0-8, majority survived. It's a small sample size 11-9, but one often used in statistics. We slightly improve our accuracy, but not much to move us past 82%. So, we'll stop here.\n",
    "\n",
    "Question 3B (going down the male branch with count = 577): Going back to question 2, we know the majority of males died. So, we are looking for a feature that identifies a subgroup that majority survived. Surprisingly, class or even embarked didn't matter like it did for females, but title does and gets us to 82%. Guess and checking other features, none seem to push us past 82%. So, we'll stop here for now.\n",
    "\n",
    "You did it, with very little information, we get to 82% accuracy. On a worst, bad, good, better, and best scale, we'll set 82% to good, since it's a simple model that yields us decent results. But the question still remains, can we do better than our handmade model?"
